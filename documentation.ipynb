Data Processing and Querying Software Documentation

In this comprehensive guide, we will provide you with a detailed overview of our software solution designed to address the challenges of processing data stored in different formats and simultaneously querying two distinct types of databases: a Graph Database and a Relational Database.

Project Overview:
In today's data-driven world, organizations and individuals often find themselves dealing with data in various formats, ranging from structured CSV files to complex JSON documents. Managing and extracting valuable insights from this diverse data can be a complex task. Our software aims to simplify this process by offering a unified platform for data ingestion, processing, and querying, while accommodating both graph and relational databases.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and user-friendly software tool that enables users to:

Ingest data from different formats: JSON and CSV.
Store the processed data in two distinct types of databases:
Graph Database: Managed by the Graph Data Processor and queried using the Graph Query Processor.
Relational Database: Managed by the Relational Data Processor and queried using the Relational Query Processor.
Query these databases simultaneously using predefined operations.
Provide users with the ability to manipulate and query data using dataframes for additional flexibility.
